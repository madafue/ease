# Equal Access Software Environment

This is a proof-of-concept program that aims to aid those with visual impairment, particularly with sending emails. Created in late 2017, this project was one of the finalists for our elementary STEM Fair. It's been uploaded to GitHub for archival purposes: it is impractical to use, and has been eclipsed by recent advances in technology. 

This is my first ever *real* programming project. I'd like to think I've grown since this.
